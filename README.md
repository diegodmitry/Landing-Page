Instructions
____________________________________________________

This project builds the functionality of a webpage, starting from an HTML file with an unknown number of sections and populates a navigation bar based on them using Javascript.

It tracks whether a scetion is in the viewport and highlights respective navbar item and starts CSS animations. Also, it reveals a "Go to top" button after first scroll.

The project is made for Udacity's Front End Web Developer Nanodegree.


Why the project is useful?
Landing pages eliminate the intermediary step by being the page the user wants - and stating as much in no uncertain terms.
